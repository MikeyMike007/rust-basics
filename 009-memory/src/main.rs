    /* 9.49. Ownership
     * -------------------------
     * Only one variable can own a piece of memory. When we create a variable, we are basically
     * creating a reference to a specific part of the memory that is uniqly assicoated with this
     * variable. This provides memory guarantee i.e. no other variable can change that part of
     * memory. When we trandfer ownershipm, that impÃ¥acts how we can use those two variables that
     * are involved in this transaction
     *
     * For primitive types (integers, booleans, floats):
     * Copy data is cheap since we know the amount of memory that is required for that transaction.
     * When we change ownership of data, we do that through copying a variable to another
     * primitive.
     *
     * For complex types (structures etc): Ownership is transferred. We do not know the size at
     * compile time so that means that we can not make guarantees for memory at compile time when we
     * transfer ownership. When we make an operation with a complex type, ownership is transferred.

     *  let b = &a; // BORROWING
     *  println!("b: {}", *b); // DEREFERENCE
     *
     *  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BORROW MUST MATCH MUTABILITY

    /* 9.51. LIFETIME
     *
     * LIFETIME is an indication of how long an object will live

     * of memory where owner is pointing (Person with name "john") becomes invalid for some reason.
     * Then the owner will be pointing to invalid data. Rust doesnt accept that. How can we solve
     * this problem? WE CAN USE THE LIFETIME SPECIFIER!! ðŸŽ‰
     *
     * THIS SPECIFIER WILL TELL THE SYSTEM THAT THE REFERENCE WILL LIFE AS LONG AS PERSON (p1) IS LIVING.
     *
     * This means Rust prevents parts of obhects outliving the object
     *
     * struct Object<'lifetime> {
     * field: &'lifetime str
     * }
